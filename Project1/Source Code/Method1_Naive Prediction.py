# Direct Prediction
# trick:
#		Since in test file there are 1000 real edges and 1000 fake edges (already known),
#		and we can find 366 edges in test file actually appeared in train.txt,
#		hence among the remaining 1634 edges, there are 634 real edges and 1000 fake edges.
#		With this inference, for the unappeared edges, we can set prob 634/1634 to be real and 1000/1634 to be fake

#		However, in theory, we can have better performence if we judge 634 real edges and 1364 fake edges (just because
#		they didn't appear in train.txt). Because in this process, we can definitely have an accuracy of 1634/2000
